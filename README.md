# CosaCompro

### What is it?
A simple app to manage grocery lists and prices. The idea is that you can create multiple lists
(i.e. a summer grocery list, a diet grocery list and so on...) and dynamically check the prices of the groceries
(including, of course, the stores/places where you can buy them).

I know, the idea is as old as the world but it's my first app for Android.
You can't jump to Mars if you haven't been on the Moon first, right?

### What does "CosaCompro" mean?
It means "What do I buy" in Italian. So creative.

### Why uploading something so common and terribly coded?
I need to practice with both Android and Git. And written English. I wanna be in shape for when I'll get a real job.
